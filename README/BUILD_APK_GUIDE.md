# 🚀 Simple APK Build Guide

Since the automated builds have complications, here are your **2 BEST OPTIONS**:

## **Option 1: EASIEST - Use Expo Go (NO APK Build Needed!)**

Your friends can download **Expo Go** from Play Store, then scan a QR code to test your app.

**Steps:**

1. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   cd mobile
   npm start
   ```

2. Choose **Android** or scan the QR code with Expo Go app
3. Share the QR code or link with your friends
4. They download Expo Go from Play Store
5. Scan QR code in Expo Go → Your app loads!

**Pros:**

- ✅ No build needed!
- ✅ Can be done in 2 minutes
- ✅ Instant testing

**Cons:**

- Friends need Expo Go app
- Limited to Expo features

## **Option 2: Pre-built APK (Coming Soon)**

I'm working on getting a proper APK build set up. This will give your friends a standalone APK that doesn't require Expo Go.

**Status:** Waiting for EAS initialization to complete

---

## **Recommended Action:**

Use **Option 1 (Expo Go)** for testing TODAY, then we'll set up Option 2 (standalone APK) for distribution.
